# Installation
Remote Incident Manager is packaged as a virtual appliance (OVA) that can be installed on any VMWare product. We will provide instructions for VMWare Workstation Player on Windows, Fusion on the Mac, and VMWare ESXi.
## VMWare Workstation Player.
1. Acquire and install [VMWare Workstation Player](https://download3.vmware.com/software/WKST-PLAYER-1700/VMware-player-full-17.0.0-20800274.exe) and take care of any updates to it if need be.
1. Open your downloaded RIM package. Workstation Player will bring up the import wizard.
1. Give the VM a name, then press enter.
1. The virtual machine should boot up momentarily. A beep will confirm that it is ready.
<!-- end -->
## VMWare Fusion
Fusion requires an account to be created, so we cannot provide the download link directly. Once Fusion is downloaded, installed and configured:
1. Open your downloaded RIM package. Fusion Player will bring up the import wizard.
1. Click the "Continue" button.
1. A standard save as dialogue will appear, at which point you can give the virtual machine a name and press enter.
1. Once the import completes, click the "Finish" button.
1. The virtual machine should boot up momentarily. A beep will confirm that it is ready.
<!-- end -->
## VMWare ESXi
Remote Incident Manager should run under most recent versions of the ESXi server. In order to deploy RIM:
1. Once in the esXi host client, click on "Create or register a Virtual Machine."
1. In the "Select Creation Type" list, choose "Deploy a virtual machine from an OVF or OVA file," then click the next button.
1. Name the virtual machine, then click the "Choose Files:" button. A standard file upload browse window will appear where you can select the .ova file you downloaded.
1. In the "Select the storage type and datastore" screen, you can safely leave everything at its default and hit next.
1. The options in the Select deployment options screen can also be left at their defaults. In particular, it is recommended to ensure "Power on automatically" is checked. If everything is to your liking, hit next.
1. The final screen will allow you to review your settings. Click Finish on this screen, then wait while the vm deploys.
<!-- end -->
Once the VM is deployed, it will power on. If you are not automatically placed within the VM overview screen, click on Virtual" Machines" in the main navigation bar, then click on your new virtual machine. Once inside, click on "Networking." You should see a list of IP addresses, the first one being the IPV4 address. This is the one you will use within your DNS. Allow the IP address to resolve to the hostname of your choosing, then visit the location in your web browser to access the RIM server web interface.

# Updates
Updates will be distributed in the form of iso images.
## VMWare Workstation Player 
When downloading the iso, we recommend saving it in the same directory as the virtual machine. Once downloaded:
1. From within the VM library, click on "Edit virtual machine settings"
    1. If inside the virtual machine, access the option off the menu or press *CTRL+D*.
1. Select "CD/DVD (IDE)" in the list of hardware devices.
1. Select "Use ISO image file:" or press *Alt+M*.
1. In the "Use ISO image file:" combo-box, type or paste the name of the iso, then press enter.
1. Power up or restart the virtual machine.
    <!-- end -->
## Fusion
    The process for Fusion is somewhat similar, with some differences as described below. First and foremost, it does not matter where you save the iso image.
1. After selecting the RIM server in your virtual machine library, locate the "Settings" button in the toolbar or press *Command+E*.
1. Select "CD/DVD (IDE)" in the new screen that appears.
1. Activate the "This CD/DVD drive is configured to use the following:" pop up button
1. Select "Choose a disc or disc image â€¦" from the menu.
1. Locate your iso, then click on the file or press enter.
1. Close the settings screen, then start up or restart the virtual machine.
## ESXi
In order to apply a new ISO image:
1. Power off the virtual machine.
1. Click on "Edit the virtual machine's settings."
1. Click on CD/DVD drive.
1. Click the Choose Files:" button, then select the iso you downloaded.
1. Wait for the iso to upload, click on it, then click "Select."
1. Power up the virtual machine.
