## Server shows up as unlicensed

The server's authentication system is designed to be resistent to most system configuration changes, however there are some occasions (such as a hard-drive or cpu upgrade) that can render the license token invalid. Should this occur, the "Refresh License" button on the main server dashboard will relaunch the same activation process you went through at time of server configuration. The currently active license will be retreived from your account, and your server will be operational once more.
